# How it works

Change code and documentation together in atomic commits.

Documentation source files are stored in the main branch under `/docs`.

Your repository must be configured to use GitHub Actions as the source of your pages.

Additionally you must ensure that GitHub Actions workflows can push to the _gh-pages_ branch. The easiest way is to assign write permissions to all workflows.

Run `npm install` in the root directory and then `npm start` to launch a development version of VuePress.

You can commit your docs as often as you like, your site won't be updated until you push changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
When you are ready to publish changes, run `./publish.sh`. You should configure a GitHub Action to do this automatically when commits are pushed to the main branch.
